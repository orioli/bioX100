# BioX-100 BioDesing Innovation  (pilot course)

## Executive summary

1. Inspired by BMEN90030 {6} courses  50% of teams launch a startup 

3. The teams will create:

 -  an engineering prototype or Minimum Viable Product of their invention
 - draft a provisional patent application
 - compose a detailed business plan

3. BioDesign Innovation is taught by a combination of 

 - academics
 - medical device entrepreneurs
 - corporate executives
 - intellectual property attorneys
 - venture capitalists

As such, it provides a unique opportunity to gain real world experience while still in an academic environment.

## Target audience

- Registered Master students (/any/).
- Completed Master education or 21 months work experience.

## Intended Learnign Outcomes (ILO)

On completion students should be able to:

1. Work as part of an interdisciplinary team to complete a technical project (e.g. startup)

2. Search, analyse and document clinical practice, engineering science and relevant literature in order to evaluate the need for further research and development in a chosen clinical area

3. Devise a methodology of investigation to research and apply established theories to an interdisciplinary body of knowledge and practice

4. Collect and analyse a range of data (both qualitative and quantitative) to analyse critically, reflect on and synthesise complex information, problems, concepts and theories in a chosen topic

5. Build a device or software MVP that helps to technologically address a clinical need

6. Develop a business plan, including market overview, regulation and reimbursement strategies and intellectual property (IP) strategies

## About your instructor (TBD) 

Jose Berengueres — Jose received a PhD in bio-inspired robotics from the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Currently he teaches Data-Driven Innovation (DS551) and Project Management (DS552) at SEDS. He has taught executive education globally (Business Model Innovation, Design Thinking, Big Data). He also consults on innovation for companies such as Apple, Lulu Group, Etihad Airways and Porsche Middle East. He has developed various startups such as a digital note-taking app for social sciences (QualNotes AB, 2024). Jose has also coached entrepreneurs at the university incubator on growth hacking and business modelling and occasionally angel invests in edtech. He has also coached several student startups such as (Masdar's Audiomatic {5}) which won the Entrepreneurship World Cup 2024 UAE Final. He has authored various books including Building Business Models (2018), The Brown Book of Design Thinking (2011), Sketch Thinking (2015) and the bestseller textbook Introduction to Data Visualization & Storytelling (2019) with more than 15,000 copies sold worldwide {1,2}. He serves as Associate Editor of IEEE Transactions on Technology and Society and also on MDPI’s Special Issue on AI & the Future of Work. Dr. Jose also has experience with intellectual property with several AI and mechanical patents and is the inventor of the Fleximouse {3} among other inventions. He has also a proven track record creating popular interdisciplinary courses, such as IBLC124 - a pioneering Desing Thinking course at undegrad level {4}, A pioneering data vizdualization coure {2}.
